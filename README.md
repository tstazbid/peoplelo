## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using Bootstrap for responsiveness. Additionally, Font Awesome icons are used for buttons such as Block, Unblock, and Delete, as well as to toggle the visibility of passwords.

- **Bootstrap**: The application uses Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities.
- **FontAwesome**: Icons are used to represent different user management actions like block, unblock, and delete.

## Configuration

- The app uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and role management.
- Password policies are configured for simplicity (you can adjust this as per your security needs).
- Email verification is required to confirm the userâ€™s identity after registration (under development).

## Scripts

- **Validation Scripts**: The project uses `_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml` to include client-side validation scripts that ensure correct input during registration and email verification.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: The toggle function is implemented using JavaScript to show or hide passwords during registration.

## User Management Actions

- **Block User**: User can block users by clicking on the block icon.
- **Unblock User**: User can unblock users by clicking on the unblock icon.
- **Delete User**: User can delete users by clicking on the trash icon.
- **Select Users**: User can select multiple users to perform actions on them.
